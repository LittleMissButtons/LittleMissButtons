### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexis (she/her) and I go by the handle LittleMissButtons.

I am a Quantity Surveyor/Estimator and making the shift to Web Development. I used to be an Estimating Manager leading a team and completing my own projects at the same time whilst also sitting on the construction board team. 

I am early on in my studies although looking to progress quickly. My first webpage was done in 1999 with just html although didn't do another one until starting my studies in 2022.

I am currently working through FreeCodeCamp ciriculum and looking front to starting Front-End-Foxes course.
