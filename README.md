### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexis (she/her) and I go by the handle LittleMissButtons.

I am a Quantity Surveyor/Estimator and making the shift to Web Development. I used to be an Estimating Manager leading a team and completing my own projects at the same time whilst also sitting on the construction board team.
